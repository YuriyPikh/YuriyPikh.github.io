                    Unless you've been living under a soundproof rock for the last two decades, you will have undoubtedly heard of the legendary Arctic Monkeys. Churning out hits such as 'I Bet You Look Good On The Dancefloor', 'When The Sun Goes Down' and 'R U Mine?', the band have achieved monumental world-wide fame with their ever-changing sound since they burst onto the music scene in 2005.
                    After the release of their seventh album 'The Car', them finishing the UK leg of their tour AND a packed Glastonbury 2023 headline slot, it's a good time to get to know the 'Why'd You Only Call Me When You're High?' legends. Want to know more about what they're working on now? Keep reading...

                    Arctic Monkeys started back in 2002, as an instrumental only group. Alex and Matt, who were close friends and neighbours at the time, teamed up with their pal Andy to form the group. After the addition of Jamie, the Arctic Monkeys played their first official gig in 2003 and soon began recording demo tracks.

                    The Arctic Monkeys are from Sheffield in South Yorkshire, England. The band’s first ever gig in 2003 was at a pub in Sheffield City Centre called The Grapes.

                    The Arctic Monkeys began to gain popularity as they handed out CDs, containing their 18 demo tracks, at various gigs. The group also gained quite the following on the social media platform MySpace, and are now described as one of the first bands to come to the public’s attention through the Internet.

                    The band’s large following on MySpace aided them in the promotion of their debut EP 'Five Minutes with Arctic Monkeys', which was released in 2005. Following on from this - when performing on the Carling Stage, reserved for unsigned/less known bands, at both Reading and Leeds Festivals, the gang attracted an unusually large crowd.

                    In their early days, Arctic Monkeys would attend, and often play support, at fellow Sheffield band Milburn's gigs. Many fans have since drawn comparisons between the two bands' music, claiming there is a striking similarity between their chords and lyrics.

                    Despite recording multiple demo tracks from the moment they formed back in 2002, the Arctic Monkeys first official single was the iconic ‘I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor’. The debut track was released in October 2005, and flew straight to the Number 1 spot on the UK Singles Chart.

                    The track, which featured on their 2006 debut album ‘Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not’, was ranked Number 7 on NME's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time and was nominated for multiple awards.
